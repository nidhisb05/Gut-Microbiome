# Introduction
As seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:plot1-pre-and-exam-scores) the pre-exam and exam scores for individuals consuming placebo or probiotics.

As seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:plot2-cortisol-and-pulserate) the cortisol levels and pulse rates at rest and under stress for the placebo or probiotic groups.

As seen in Table\ \@ref(tab:table1-summary-and-mean-values) the summary mean values of academic performance and stress variables for both placebo and probiotic treatment groups.

## Hypothesis

### Definitions

# In-line references:
# Methods - Count of Placebo and Probiotic participants in the dataset
This study included `r nrow(filter(probiotics.stress.data, group == "placebo"))` healthy medical students in the Placebo group, and `r nrow(filter(probiotics.stress.data, group == "saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic)"))` healthy medical students in the Saccharomyces boulardii (Probiotic) group.

# Results - Reference the p-value for analysis
The salivary cortisol levels "at rest" and "under stress" were measured for the placebo and probiotic groups. The p-value of `r ttest_placebo_probiotic_cortisol$p.value`, showed that the difference in the "at rest" and "under stress" salivary cortisol levels in the placebo and probiotic groups is not statistically significant. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

# Count the number of participant IDs that are outliers. 
Defining an outlier as 2.5 * inter quartile range, the number of outliers present during the salivary cortisol under stress condition is ` r nrow(filter(probiotics.stress.data, `cortisol under stress` > 2.5*IQR(probiotics.stress.data$`cortisol under stress`)))`.

# Mean cortisol level for placebo and probiotic samples in the dataset
The mean salivary cortisol level for the placebo group was ` r round(mean(filter(probiotics.stress.data, group == "placebo")$`cortisol under stress`), 3)`[ng/mL], and for the probiotic group was ` r round(mean(filter(probiotics.stress.data, group == "saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic)")$`cortisol under stress`), 3)`[ng/mL]. However, after excluding the outliers in both groups, the mean salivary cortisol level for the placebo group was `r round(mean(filter(probiotics.stress.data, group == "placebo" | `cortisol under stress` < 2.5 * IQR(`cortisol under stress`))$`cortisol under stress`))` [ng/mL], and for the probiotic group was `r round(mean(filter(probiotics.stress.data, group == "saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic)" | `cortisol under stress` < 2.5 * IQR(`cortisol under stress`))$`cortisol under stress`))` [ng/mL].

# Results - Plot Histogram
The salivary cortisol levels data shows a right skew, as exhibited by `r hist(probiotics.stress.data$`cortisol under stress`, freq = FALSE, main = "Normal Distribution", xlab = "cortisol under stress", ylab = "Density")`. To make it a normal distribution of values before performing the statistical analysis, we need to log the values.


## Participants
**Healthy Medical Students**

## Material
Probiotic used is _Saccharomyces Boulardii_
