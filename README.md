# Gut-Microbiome
Supplementation of probiotics and it's effects on academic performance and stress marker levels at rest and under stress conditions repository for MAPS30550. 


# Brief Descrption of Dataset
The dataset displays the results from the Karbownik MS et al. (2020) study "Effects of Supplementation with Saccharomyces Boulardii on Academic Examination Performance and Related Stress in Healthy Medical Students: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial." Whether an individual was in the probiotic group is indiciated with "S" and the placebo group is indicated with "P." The dataset includes a few demographic variables, stress-related variables such as anxiety and cortisol levels at rest and under stress, and pharmacology examination points pre- and post-examination.

# Brief Overview of Planned Project
The research question proposed is "whether administration of Saccharomyces Boulardii improves academic examination performance and lowers salivary-cortisol levels in healthy medical students." The hypothesis states that Saccharomyces Boulardii will improve academic examination scores and decrease salivary-cortisol levels.

## Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference betweenn placebo and *S. boulardii* supplementation on academic performance and stress marker levels in healthy medical students.

Alternative Hypothesis: Supplementation with *S.boulardii* will improve academic performance and decrease stress marker levels in healthy medical students.
