# Abstract
Recent research has shed light on the gut microbiome’s impact on brain function through the gut-brain axis (GBA), which is necessary to regulate various host physiological processes. Stressful experiences can disrupt gut microbiome functioning, leading to changes in brain responses and cognitive function. Therefore, it is necessary to restore this gut microbiome regulation during stress to promote cognitive health. Probiotics contain strains of live microorganisms, that can potentially offer beneficial effects to promote overall well-being. While bacterial probiotics like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have shown significant effects in enhancing cognitive function and reducing stress markers, research on yeast probiotics remains limited. This paper aimed to analyze the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii supplementation on academic performance and stress levels in healthy medical students. The participants were randomly assigned either the placebo or S. boulardii (probiotic) group, and their academic performance and stress markers (state anxiety, salivary cortisol, and pulse rate) during “at rest” or “under stress” conditions was assessed. While the results did not demonstrate any significant effect on examination performance or stress levels with the administration of  S. boulardii, there was an increase in pulse rate with S. boulardii supplementation, potentially suggesting the body’s “fight or flight” stress response was activated. 

# Brief Descrption of Dataset
The dataset displays the results from the Karbownik MS et al. (2020) study "Effects of Supplementation with Saccharomyces boulardii on Academic Examination Performance and Related Stress in Healthy Medical Students: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial." Whether an individual was in the probiotic group is indicated with "S" and the placebo group is indicated with "P." The dataset includes a few demographic variables, stress-related variables such as anxiety and cortisol levels at rest and under stress, and pharmacology examination points pre- and post-examination.

# Brief Overview of Planned Project
The research question proposed is "whether administration of Saccharomyces Boulardii improves academic examination performance and lowers salivary-cortisol levels in healthy medical students." The hypothesis states that Saccharomyces Boulardii will improve academic examination scores and decrease salivary-cortisol levels.

## Hypothesis
**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference between placebo and *S. boulardii* supplementation on academic performance and stress levels in healthy medical students.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** Supplementation with *S.boulardii* will enhance academic performance and alter stress marker levels in healthy medical students.
